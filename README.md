# Virtual Cinema Records

Virtual Cinema Records is an online web application where users can view trending movies, search for movies, and get recommendations based on different criteria such as genre. Users can also create accounts which allows them to rate movies which we use to generate personalized recommendations based on their movie ratings. If users don't like a movie they can blacklist it and it won't pop up in searches or future recommendations.
